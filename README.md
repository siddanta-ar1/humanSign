# HumanSign – Keystroke Notary System

HumanSign is an open-source project that explores **keystroke dynamics** as a method for **human verification and digital notarization**.  
The system analyzes how a user types (timing, rhythm, patterns) rather than *what* they type, to help verify identity in a non-intrusive way.

## 🧠 What is Keystroke Dynamics?
Keystroke dynamics is a behavioral biometric technique that identifies users based on typing behavior such as:
- Key press and release timing
- Typing rhythm and patterns
- Consistency across sessions

HumanSign uses these characteristics to help distinguish genuine human users from impersonation or automated behavior.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of HumanSign is to:
- Build a **transparent and auditable keystroke-based verification system**
- Explore its use as a **notary-style trust mechanism**
- Promote **open research and ethical use** of behavioral biometrics

| **The Problem** | **The Solution** |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Current AI-detection systems rely on **content analysis**, which can be easily bypassed using "AI humanizer" tools. | **HumanSign** ignores content and focuses on the **writing process** (keystroke dynamics) for verification. |
| **Honest work** is falsely flagged as AI-generated, especially from non-native speakers, while sophisticated AI content passes undetected. | We provide **cryptographic proof** of authorship and authenticity through typing behavior and patterns. |
| **Adversarial AI** now reliably beats all traditional **statistical content detectors**. | Our solution uses **behavioral biometrics** (typing rhythm and timing), which are harder to fake or manipulate than content alone. |

## 🔍 Use Cases (Conceptual)
- Identity verification
- Continuous authentication
- Anti-bot or anti-impersonation systems
- Research and experimentation with behavioral biometrics

## 🚧 Project Status
This project is **under active development** and primarily intended for:
- Academic exploration
- Prototyping
- Open-source collaboration

It is **not production-ready** and should not be used as a sole security mechanism.
